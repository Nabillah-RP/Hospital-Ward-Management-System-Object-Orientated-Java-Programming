# Hospital-Ward-Management-System-Object-Orientated-Java-Programming

# I developed a WardManagement program for hospital staff to view and manage patients, including their visits. This project involved creating multiple classes, implementing various functionalities, and ensuring robust exception handling. 

# The program's purpose was to simulate a real-world hospital ward management system, enhancing my skills in object-oriented programming, data structures, and software design.
